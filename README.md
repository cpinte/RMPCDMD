RMPCDMD: Reactive MultiParticle Collision Dynamics - Molecular Dynamics
=======================================================================

**Author:** [Pierre de Buyl](http://pdebuyl.be/)

RMPCDMD is a collection of Fortran modules and programs for the
mesoscopic modeling of chemically active fluids with embedded colloids.

This software represents the development version of the author to
perform his research on nanomotor modeling.

Contributions from Peter Colberg, either in the code or via
discussions, are warmly acknowledged.

## Status

A former version of this code, still available in the branches `trs`
and `trs_two_prod`, was used to obtain the results presented in P. de
Buyl and R. Kapral [Nanoscale 5, 1337-1344
(2013)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C2NR33711H) and P. de Buyl,
A. S. Mikhailov and R. Kapral [EPL 103, 60009
(2013)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/103/60009).

The current version is under total refactoring to remove the use of
global variables, enable testing and plan for parallel accelerations.
