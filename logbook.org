* Setup of basic MD features
<2015-11-26 Thu>

Velocity verlet and RATTLE for the dimer are working properly and most of the MD code is
moved to modules.

* A round of profiling
<2015-11-27 Fri>

Using =test/setup_single_dimer.f90= as a basis, identify most time-consuming parts of the
code:
- simple_mpcd_step
- maximum_displacement
- compact_p_to_h

The MPCD step requires line profiling and/or a parallel RNG to speed things up.

The displacement routine has been accelerated by resetting particles in the PBC box only
upon resorting, so that the call to =rel_pos= can be removed.

No idea yet for compact_p_to_h.
